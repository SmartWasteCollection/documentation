## Model Diagram

The following diagram shows the aggregates of the disposal subdomain. 

<!--![Diagram Image Link](./disposal-domain-model.puml)-->

## Domain Events

The following events are generated by the *Dumpster Aggregate*:

* **Citizen Disposal Event**: generated when a citizen disposes of some waste.
* **Volume Update Event**: generated when the volume sensor detects a disposal.
* **Opening Event**: generated when the dumpster is opened.
* **Closure Event**: generated when the dumpster is closed.
* **Mission Request Event**: generated when the dumpster's occupied volume exceeds its threshold.
* **Availability Update Event**: generated when the dumpster becomes available or unavailable.

## Domain Factories

* **Dumpster Static Factory**: generates dumpsters defining their *TypeOfDumpster*.

## Domain Invariants

* *TIMEOUT* = 30 seconds.
* *OCCUPIED_VOLUME_THRESHOLD* = 75%.
* *occupiedVolume < capacity*.
* *Citizen Disposal Events* are accepted *iff isAvailable == true*.
* *Opening Events* are accepted *iff isAvailable == true*.
* *isAvailable = false* only when *isWorking == false* or *occupiedVolumePercentage > 95%*.
* *TypesOfWaste* are mapped to one and one only *Color*, and vice versa.
