# Impact Mapping

The following impact map has derived from the analysis of the business problem. It allows to underline the main aspects 
of the problem, starting from the **goal** of the project. The goal is pursued by each **actor** in the system and the 
diagram helps to identify which **deliverables** will have the greater **impacts**. In fact, it can be seen as a first 
draft of the requirements.
