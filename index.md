# Introduction 

This website contains all the documentation produced for the ```SmartWasteCollection``` project, which is brought on 
with a Domain Driven approach.

## The Project

### Description
The aim of the project is to optimize the management of waste collection using smart technologies. 

At the moment, waste is collected by **garbage trucks** regularly from **collection points** distributed across the cities' streets.
At each collection point there are several **dumpsters** for each **waste type**. 
People can go to collection points, open a dumpster manually and dispose of the **waste**. A single garbage truck collects a specific type of waste from various collection points.

There are also **extraordinary waste** types that are not collected at collection points.
Instead, them must be brought directly to disposal points by citizens.

The optimization we want to make to the infrastructure is to collect waste from collection points only when necessary, avoiding wasted garbage trucks missions.

Dumpsters will be provided with sensors in order to identify when they must be emptied.
These sensors will provide information about the state of the dumpster itself, not only about its remaining capacity.
