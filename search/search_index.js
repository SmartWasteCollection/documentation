The Project Description At the moment, waste is collected by garbage trucks regularly from collection points distributed across the cities' streets. At each collection point there are several dumpsters for each waste type. People can go to collection points, open a dumpster manually and dispose of the waste. There is also extraordinary waste that is not collected at collection points. Instead, it must be brought directly to disposal points by citizens. We aim to optimize the waste collection process using smart technologies. The idea is to collect waste from collection points only when it is necessary. A single garbage truck collects a specific type of waste from various collection points. Dumpsters are provided with sensors in order to identify when they must be emptied. This sensors provide information about the state of the dumpster itself, not only about its remaining capacity.
