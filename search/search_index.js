The Project Description In the actual situation, waste is collected by garbage trucks periodically from collection points distributed across the cities' streets. In each collection point there are several dumpsters for each waste type. People can go to collection points and interact with a single dumpster by opening it manually and throwing out the waste. We aim to optimize the waste collection process using smart technologies. The idea is to collect waste from collection points only when needed. A single garbage truck collects a specific waste type from the collection points. Dumpsters are provided with specific sensors in order to know when it's the right time to empty them. The set of sensors on a dumpster provides information about the state of the dumpster itself, not only about the occupied volume.
